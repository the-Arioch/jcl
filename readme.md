JEDI Code Library
=================

The JEDI Code Library (JCL) consists of a set of thoroughly tested and fully documented
utility functions and non-visual classes which can be instantly reused in your Delphi
and C++ Builder projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. It is reformatted to achieve
a common look-and-feel, tested, documented and merged into the library. The library is
grouped into several categories such as Strings, Files and I/O, Security, Math and many, many
more. The library is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL)
and as such can be freely used in both freeware/shareware, opensource and commercial projects.
The entire JEDI Code Library is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL).

This includes, but is not limited to, this document and all source code and ancillary files.
Source code files included in the JCL have a header which explicitly states this (as is required)
however, unless noted otherwise, all files including those without an MPL header, are subject
to the MPL license.

Download the ZIP file
---------------------

If you download the JCL as a ZIP file from GitHub, you have to download the jedi.inc and
kylix.inc file from the <https://github.com/project-jedi/jedi> project and copy them to the
jcl\jcl\source\include\jedi directory.

Clone with GIT
--------------

```
> git clone git://github.com/project-jedi/jcl.git jcl
> cd jcl
> git submodule update --init
```

This will get you the JCL repository and initializes the submodule that contains the jedi.inc and kylix.inc files.

How to install
--------------
Start the **jcl\install.bat**
